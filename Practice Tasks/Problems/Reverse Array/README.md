# Reverse an Array

The **Reverse an Array** problem requires reversing the order of elements in a given array such that:

1. The first element becomes the **last**.  
2. The second element becomes the **second last**.  
3. And so on, until the array is fully reversed.  

The goal is to produce the array in reverse order while keeping all elements the same.

## Example

#### For **arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**:

Output:
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
