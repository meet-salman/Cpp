# Rotate an Array

The **Rotate an Array** problem requires shifting the elements of an array by `k` positions:

1. In a **Left Rotation**, elements are shifted to the left, and the first elements move to the end.  
2. In a **Right Rotation**, elements are shifted to the right, and the last elements move to the beginning.  

The goal is to rotate the array in the specified direction while preserving all elements.

## Example

#### For **arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2**:


### Left Rotation Output:

```
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

### Right Rotation Output:
```
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
